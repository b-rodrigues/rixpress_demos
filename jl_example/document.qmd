This is an example that shows how `{rixpress}` handles Julia and R derivations.

The DAG of the pipeline looks like this:

```{r}
rixpress::rxp_read("dag")
```

The purple icons are derivations that build Julia artifacts, the blue ones use R
and the last one is this Quarto document.

Julia is used to generate the underlying data to this `{ggplot2}` plot:

```{r}
rixpress::rxp_read("gg")
```
